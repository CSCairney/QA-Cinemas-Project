            Hi, my name is Abdi and I am a full stack web developer at QA
            I am a film enthusiast and thus have really enjoyed developing QA Cinemas with my fab dev team!
            I will be closely monitoring the site's performance closely with my team and looking forward to hearing your thoughts.
          </p>
